# guitar_practice_generator
an app that generates guitar practice ideas

Thanks for visiting!

In general, the user should be able to generate a practice routine for a day, week or a month,
based on topic criteria and have it stored on his account. Ability to print / download the sheets is paramount.

(if you know your stuff around music and guitar, the exercies/topics that the generator will produce
will be based around Steve Vai’s 30h workout)
