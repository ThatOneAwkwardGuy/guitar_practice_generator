# Guitar Practice Generator

## Introduction
An app that generates guitar practice ideas.


## Synopsis
The app will be generating practice routines for guitarists.
Routines will be in a form of a set of exercises based on technical, theoretical and conceptual topics regarding playing the guitar.

App should search through the database of exercises and based on the users criteria compose the practice routines.

## User story example

User selects that a practice session lasts 60 minutes, his technical ability is medium and theoretical knowledge zero.
User selects to generate seven days worth of practice routines.
Based on this criteria app generates a routine of exercises, and adds them to users database.
User is able to tick off (complete) or save certain exercises or whole routines as favourites to be viewed later.

App should have on-screen timers for every exercise and a built-in metronome or a drum machine.

Ideally the exercises would be modular and users should be able to favourite them separately to compose own practice routines.

(if you know your stuff around music and guitar, the exercise/topics that the generator will produce
will be based around Steve Vai’s 30h workout)
