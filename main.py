# some notes on how to store data


#scales
chromatic = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
major = [0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11]
minor = [0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10]
blues = [0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10]
# every integer represents the distance from the root note
# 0 is the root note, 7 is a perfect 5th, 3 is a minor 3rd etc
# the possible intervals are from the root up until major 7th
