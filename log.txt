### This is a project that I started for the '100 days of code' challenge. 
### It is going to be an app that generates a guitar practice ideas, written in Python3.
### This log will be used for notes on the development ideas and other app-related scribbles.
### General progress and thoughts on 100 days of code will be posted on www.danielkblogs.wordpress.com
### To understand many things within the app, a basic knowledge of music theory and guitar playing is necessary - please email me at danielkaczmarczyk2@gmail.com or tweet to me @_daniel_tweets if you have any questions.

Day 1
Friday, 6th January, 2017

I will start with a command line tool, but the plan is to deploy it as a full-blown web app.

App features:
	Scale generator
	Arpeggio generator

	Scale database
	Arpeggio database

	Rhythm generator

	Chord progression generator

	Theoretical topic generator

	Technical practice generator

	Tabulature printer

	Chord diagram printer

	Scale diagram printer

Functionality:
	User should be able to choose: 
		- how much time there is to practice
		- what kind of exercises to work on:
			- technique/theory/scales/chords
		- should be able to export it to pdf/csv/txt
		- email it automatically
			- set an email subscription
		- check off what's done
		- keep record of created entries
		- have the ability to browse favourites
		- create names for the favourites

Things I have to do:
	- Find a complete list of musical scales / chords, some kind of compendium
	and include it as a txt/csv/json file for my program to use

Functions to build:
	- Scale translator from integer list to a printable version, example:
		blues = [0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10]
		blues = '1, b3, 4, b5, 5, b7'
	- Random scale/arpeggio generator, example output:
		rand_scale = [0, 3, 5, 9, 11]
		rand_arp = [1, 2, 6]
	- Fit checker:
		*Checks if given scale/arpeggio can be found within another scale
